        <h2>About The Recipe</h2>
        <p>Simple no knead dough for delicious bread with a spicy twist. Adding both red pepper flakes and sriracha gives this bread a devilish kick!</p>
        <p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>400 grams unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>7 grams table salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon instant dry yeast</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
                <li>260 grams cool water</li>
                <li>60 grams Sriracha sauce</li>
                <li>Wheat bran for dusting</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix the flour. salt, yeast, and pepper flakes together in a medium-sized bowl. Add in the water and Sriracha sauce. Mix using a wooden 
                    spoon or your hand until all of the flour is incorporated and the dough is sticky. This should only take 30 seconds or so. Add more 
                    water if the dough seems too dry.</li>
                <li>Transfer the dough to another bowl lightly oiled or sprayed with cooking spray. Leave one hour at room temperature, remove the dough
                     to a lightly flour surface and knead it 8 to 10 times.  Place it back in  the bowl, cover with oiled plastic wrap and leave it at 
                     room temperature for 3 more hours.  Place it in the refrigerator overnight (about 12 hours).   Remove the dough from the fridge,  
                     dump it into a lightly floured surface, and shape it as a ball.  Place it in a banneton or another appropriate container seam side up, 
                     dusted with wheat bran for its final proofing, two hours at room temperature.</li>
                <li>Heat the oven to 450 F.  After the shaped bread proofed for 2 hours, invert it on a sheet of parchment paper, so that the seam side is
                     now down. Slash the surface with a serrated knife, and place it in the oven, using your favorite method to generate steam (I bake my 
                     bread inside a large Dutch oven, and cover it with a wet lid).</li>
                <li>After 30 minutes, open the lid and allow the bread to brown for 10 to 15 minutes longer.  You can lower the oven to 425 F in case it 
                    is browning too fast.</li>
                <li>Once the loaf is a nice dark brown, take it out of the pan and set it on a wire rack to cool for at least an hour.</li>
            </ol>
